- Open the project folder and right-click `index.html` â†’ **Open with Browser**
- OR use VS Codeâ€™s **Live Server extension** to preview the site

### 2. Tailwind CSS Optimization
This project initially used **Tailwind CDN**, but for performance, unused styles were purged using the Tailwind CLI.

```sh
npx tailwindcss -i ./assets/style.css -o ./assets/output.css --minify
```
